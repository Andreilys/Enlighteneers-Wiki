# Overview

Supplements are nutritional products that are designed to provide additional nutrients that may be missing from your diet. They come in many forms, including pills, capsules, powders, and liquids, and can be derived from natural sources or synthesized in a laboratory. In recent years, research has demonstrated that certain supplements can have beneficial effects on health, making them an effective tool for health and wellness.

According to a review of the literature published in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings, supplements can provide important nutrients that may be missing from your diet. These nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, and other compounds that are essential for maintaining good health. In addition, supplements can be used to support specific health conditions, such as osteoporosis, heart disease, and diabetes.

Here are some of the main health benefits of supplements, as supported by research:

*

    * Supports bone health: Calcium and vitamin D are two important nutrients that are essential for maintaining strong and healthy bones. A study published in the journal Bone found that regular supplementation with calcium and vitamin D can increase bone density and reduce the risk of fractures in older adults. In addition, supplements can support bone health and reduce the risk of osteoporosis, a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. (Author: Bischoff-Ferrari, H.A., et al.

    * Supports heart health: Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that are important for maintaining heart health. A study published in the journal Circulation found that regular supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids can reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, and improve cholesterol levels. In addition, supplements can support heart health and reduce the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States. (Author: Mozaffarian, D., et al. Date published: 2002)
    * Supports eye health: Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoid pigments that are important for maintaining eye health. A study published in the journal Ophthalmology found that regular supplementation with lutein and zeaxanthin can improve visual function and reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration. In addition, supplements can support eye health and protect against vision loss, a common condition in older adults. (Author: Christen, W.G., et al. Date published: 2008)
    * Supports immune health: Vitamin C is an important nutrient that is essential for maintaining a healthy immune system. A study published in the journal American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that regular supplementation with vitamin C can reduce the duration and severity of the common cold.
